# Stock GUI
This was made with a Python libary, Eel, which allows you to create HTML GUI applications with Python and JavaScript.

I created this to use on my Raspberry Pi Zero W with a 3.5" touch screen module. I wanted a custom minimalistic interface that would allow me to access stock market information in a tiny portable format.
