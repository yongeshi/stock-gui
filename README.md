# Stock GUI
This was made with Electron which is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I created this to use on my Raspberry Pi Zero W with a 3.5" touch screen module. I wanted a custom minimalistic interface that would allow me to access stock market information in a tiny portable format.
